QS1.1 (0.25 Pts): What data structure do you use for implementing DFS? Why?
Answer: We used Stack as our data structure for implementing DFS because

QS1.2 (0.25 Pts):The Pacman board will show an overlay of the states explored, and the order in which they were explored (brighter red means earlier exploration). 
Is the exploration order what you would have expected? Does Pacman actually go to all the explored squares on his way to the goal?

QS2.1 (0.25 Pts): What data structure do you use for implementing BFS? Why?

QS3.1 (0.25 Pts): What cost function did you implement?  Please briefly describe how your cost function is designed 
(what factors does it consider and how heavy of a weight has each factor considered been given?)

QS4.1 (0.75 Pts): What is the difference between the nullHeuristic  and the Manhattan distance heuristic? 
Does nullHeuristic give the optimal solution?  Why is the Manhattan distance heuristic better?

QS4.2 (0.25 Pts): What happens on openMaze for the various search strategies?

QS5.1 (0.25 Pts): What states representation do you choose in this problem?

QS5.2 (0.25 Pts): Briefly  explain your implementation

QS6.1 (0.5 Pts): What heuristic did you use for this corner problem?  
Explain the potential strong points and weak points of your chosen heuristic.  Is your heuristic consistent?  Why?

QS7.1 (0.5 Pts): What heuristic did you use for this problem?  Explain the potential strong points and weak points of your chosen heuristic.  Is your heuristic consistent?  Why?
Our UCS agent finds the optimal solution in about 13 seconds, exploring over 16,000 nodes.

QS8.1 (0.5 Pts): Describe your solution and explain the potential strong points and weak points of your solution.
